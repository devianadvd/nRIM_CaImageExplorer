# nRIM_CaImageExplorer
A straightforward set of MATLAB tools for quick visualization and basic analysis of calcium imaging data, meant for nRIM members.

Besides helping out to get quick insights from imaging data, the purpose of this repository is to explore and experiment on ways to make code and repository easily understood, maintained and modified. It aims to maintain consistency of convention, and incorporate mindful (intentional) programming principles.

This README file is a stub for now, will work in the contents later...
